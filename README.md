Once you have all the parts needed for the computer to function:
    - Make sure you have a monitor to test computer on.

Step 1:  Open the case. 
          *** Fans, external USB connection, power button, and internal speaker come with case. 
          

Step 2:  Install the power supply into the case in its proper position. 

Step 3:  Install the hard drive into the optical drive location. 

Step 4 (OPTIONAL): Install the cd/dvd drive into the optical drive location. 

Step 5:  Install the motherboard where there are bumpers in the case to keep metal from touching the motherboard. 

Step 6:  Install RAM into the RAM slots on the motherboard. 

Step 7:  Install the CPU into the specified socket on the motherboard, making sure that the triangled corner matches with the            motherboard. 

Step 8:  Install heat sink on top of the CPU. 

Step 9:  Plug power/data cords into their slots.
          - SATA cables: these should run from hard drive and cd/dvd drive to the motherboard where the designated seta ports               are for data. For power supply, SATA cables run from power supply to the hard drive and cd/dvd drive. 
          - ATX power cables: these come straight from the power supply to the motherboard. The exact spot to be plugged is                 designated on the motherboard.
          - CPU-Fan connection: comes from the heat sink to the unique plug on the motherboard.
          - Cooling fans: these should run from the fans to the motherboard plug labeled "fan 1 / fan 2". 
          - Internal speaker: plug into specified slot.
          - Power button: plug into motherboard where appropriate.
          - External USB connections: plug into motherboard where appropriate (if not already installed). 
          
Step 10:  Close case. Plug power cord into outlet and computer. 

Step 11:  Press power button, and if all done correctly, computer should turn on with no problems or beeps.

Lessons Learned:

1) Make sure RAM is secured into RAM slots, if not, when you turn the computer on, you may hear beeps. Reseat the RAM. 

2) Make sure the CPU is facing the correct way in its slot on the motherboard. 

3) Make sure power button has power to it. 

4) Double check to make sure CPU comes with a heat sink. 

5) Make sure you have a hard drive if you want to use an OS and install applications.
